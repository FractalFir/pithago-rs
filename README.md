# Ï€tha**go**-rs(pithago-rs)
This is just a name reservation.
Pithago is going to be a simple rust 3D engine build with WebGPU and WASM. The engine will load compiled WASM modules from its asset bundles and will be able to be programmed using any language supporting WASM. The engine will focus only on providing a powerful renderer, simple UI toolkit and ECS. The engine will not have anything besides that, and is meant mostly for puzzle/strategy games.
